    <h1>Online Portal for Inventory & Facility Management (Final Year Project)</h1>
    <img src="IFM.png" alt="Inventory & Facility Management System">
    <br/>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Logistics Management System encapsulates the fundamental elements of managing and controlling the inventory in a space or an organization. In a self-run Makerspace, it makes it even more challenging to do inventory management & control without the constant supervision of a manager. Facility management is usually a challenge when there is a high demand for limited spaces. Therefore, it is essential to explore ways to convert the manual Logistics & Facility Management System into one that operates on automation to eliminate the need for manual labor and processes. This project will involve a technology stack comprising of React (Front End, JavaScript Library), Express (Back End, JavaScript Framework) and MySQL.</p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
	<p>This project deals with developing an online portal for the logistics and facility management of Makerspaces in Nanyang Technological University. Currently, Makerspaces in Nanyang Technological University do not have a proper inventory and facility management system in operation. On one hand, this has led to the difficulty in controlling the movements of logistics such as electronic components and often resulting in the misplacement of items or the abuse of resources. On the other hand, this has also resulted in more stringent manual control and restrictions put in place to store the items beyond reach without permission. Additionally, the absence of a proper facility system such as space allocation has often caused conflicting confusions between users.</p>
    <p>ith the development of an online portal, requesting and ordering of logistics will be automated where users and the logistics team no longer have to go through the inefficient and laborious process. This will result in a more systematic way of tracking the inventory and gives rise to an effortless accountability of resources. An online facility management system will also give users a clear picture on the usage of the various facilities in the Makerspace at different time periods and allow reservations to be made beforehand while avoiding possible conflict in schedule.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>With the development of an online portal for the logistics and facility management of Makerspaces in Nanyang Technological University, requesting and ordering of logistics will be automated resulting in a more systematic way of tracking the inventory and giving rise to an effortless accountability of resources. An online facility management system will also give users a clear picture on the usage of the various facilities in the Makerspace at different time periods and allow reservations to be made beforehand while avoiding possible conflict in schedule. </p>
    <p>With the aim of developing a dynamic system, the interactions between the front-end and back-end will be more complicated to ensure a smooth and secure process of navigating around the web application and the databases.</p>

    <h1>LED-based Visible Light Communication (VLC) System for Long-Range Sensing/Scanning (Design & Innovation Project)</h1>
    <img src="DIP.png" alt="LED-based VLC System">
    <br/>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Visible Light Communication (VLC) refers to using visible light spectrum for short-range optical wireless communication. VLC is a viable technology to accommodate the need for faster and better wireless communications in the coming years. Data is transmitted via VLC through intensity modulating optical sources such as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). While conventional barcode-based scanning technology is ubiquitous, it is largely limited to short-range application. <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6163585/">[1]</a> In this project, long-range sensing or scanning system by the means of emerging LED-based VLC technology is proposed. </p>
    <p>The basic idea of the proposed system is that instead of using traditional methods of communication over cables or radio frequencies, the VLC systems send data by turning light on and off. The light is picked up by the android camera on the receiving end. This project comprised of a combination of Arduino IDE (Hardware, C/C++) and Android Studio (Software, Java).</p>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>The main objective of this project consists of two segments: the first part is sending a string of text for transmission while the second part involves retrieving and receiving the data entered by the user at the transmitting end via Arduino and Android interfaces.
    <p>The overall goal of this project is to be able to transmit text across a distance of 1 meter. To achieve the goal, the team had to make sure that when the text is transmitted, it would be received correctly with minimal or no errors to prove a successful transmission. </p>
    <p>The microcontroller, Arduino Uno is connected to the laptop. The text will be input from the serial monitor of the Arduino program, which will encode and transmit the data via the RGB LED. The receiver from the Android camera would then read the data from the flashing LEDs, decoding it and then display the data back to text form on the application interface.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Through the exploration of various features in both the software & hardware segments, we are able to realize the concept of an LED-based information broadcasting system. Due to many limitations, the transmission of data was not as quick or efficient as it could have been, but given that it was a proof of concept the project was a success.  The transmitter was capable of sending text through a RGB LED. The receiver was also capable of receiving and interpreting this data correctly. </p>
